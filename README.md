## Summary  

This project was part of a online course. However the Javascript code is different to the tutorial. The tutorial would check for a winning move by iterating through every cell in the table. My method would on every move perform a winner check, but it would only check three cells either side of the move for each direction. it was would check 7 cells for across, up and forward/backward diangonal. it checked 28 cells in total instead of the whole table, columns and rows.
